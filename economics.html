  <h2><a href="https://new.unca.edu/asheville-2030/asheville-2030-fact-sheet/">Where's The Money?</a></h2>

  <p>
    A 2-phase developmental plan of UNCA's South Campus and Broadway Street areas are beginning, with rising concerns
    of not only the environmental impacts, but as well as speculation with the projected "$46 million projected over
    30 years" while leasing the land for $250 million. This is due to the university's current dire straits.
  </p>

  <p>
    $6 million budget deficit stemming from enrollment decline over the past 5 years, "long-standing budgetary
    practices distorted financial assumptions and modeling. That prevented the University from identifying the scope
    of these challenges sooner."
  </p>

  <h2>Is It Beneficial?</h2>

  <p>
    A few questions have been raised in order to address the consequences of this project, and were listed on the 
    <a href="https://new.unca.edu/millennial-campus/">UNCA Millennial Campus</a> webpage, one of those being
    <b><i>"Will this divert money away from academic programs or student services?"</i></b>
  </p>

  <q>
    No. The project does not impact academic budgets. It allows the University to grow non-tuition revenue, easing
    reliance on state funding and tuition while supporting the University’s long-term mission.
  </q>

  <p>
    This testament was also echoed when Van Noort was interviewed by News 13, stating,
    <q>
      'Our educational mission is dependent upon us having students,' she said. 'Being able to attract students here
      and provide them with a comfortable and vibrant living experience is part of that mission.'
    </q>
  </p>

  <p><b>Though this plan is being contested...</b></p>

  <ul>
    In 2023, the most popular Bachelors Degree concentrations at University of North Carolina at Asheville, as stated
    by DATAUSA, were:
    <li>General Psychology (80 degrees)</li>
    <li>Environmental Studies (59 degrees)</li>
    <li>General English Language & Literature (48 degrees)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    From 2018 to 2023, the average for the amount of Environmental Studies degrees awarded was 60.33 repeating and for
    each year, ES was ranked amongst the top three degrees averaging more than <b>%6</b> of total degrees given.
    <br><br>
    Though the aim was to lessen the stress of using tuition to focus on the current financial gap, there are fears
    this move could be creating more problems than solutions, especially considering the university <a
      href="https://tinyurl.com/fhryusbe">has already cut 4 of the 27 programs and curtailed a fifth.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    The financial problems of UNCA are not unique to this university alone, though it is through the actions and
    lack thereof of the university which leads to those affected to speak up:
  </p>

  <q>
    David Clarke, a biology professor who has taught at UNCA for over two decades, has brought his field biology
    students into the forest for years, using it as a rare and accessible example of habitat in an urban area.
    'It’s my best teaching,' Clarke said. 'That doesn’t happen in the classroom. In the field, students build
    camaraderie, and we get to know each other. It’s what I should be doing.'
  </q>

  <p>
    As recorded by News13, he later goes on to state that,
    <q>
      'This isn’t a stadium for UNC Asheville’s teams, it’s a private project,' he said. 'It doesn’t serve our
      academic mission. And market-rate housing doesn’t help our students or staff, who are already priced out of this
      city.'
    </q>
  </p>

  <p>
    More information on Clarke's statement as well as Van Noort's can be found 
    <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yw32xufz">here</a>, and UNCA's statistics 
    <a href="https://datausa.io/profile/university/university-of-north-carolina-at-asheville">here</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Outside the Sphere but Important Nonetheless</h2>
  <p>
    UNCA’s woods aren’t the largest attraction in town in comparison to the Blue Ridge Parkway, Pisgah, etc., but
    they’re part of what makes Asheville appealing to tourists and students who want a walkable, wooded, eco-conscious
    town.
